# My Rust Learning Journey

This folder contains my personal notes and exercises as I work through "The Rust Programming Language" book.

## Structure

Each chapter has its own subfolder where I keep:
- Notes on important concepts
- Code examples I've written
- Exercises and practice problems
- Questions and things to revisit

## Chapters
